Data created as part of the Ohio 5 Newspaper Hackathon

This data was created as part of the Ohio 5 Hackathon.  Newspaper data from 5 colleges (Denison, Kenyon, Oberlin, Wesleyan, and Wooster) was made available to students and researchers for processing.  Attendees had 24 hours to do cool things with the data.  To help make this process easier, I did some work to create some easier to use data sets.  Since these datasets are open, and available to anyone -- I'm making them available here.  Please note the following:
* JSON data are structured as IIIF manifest files.  I had setup a namespace for this event, it no longer exists, so you'd need to update this value.
* XML files are cleaned versions of the CONTENTdm metadata
* Data created includes all information from first issue to March 2017.
* All code used to create these are written in C# and available.

All the source code used to work with these projects.

When possible, data and code is released as CC0. However, if you want to utilize this data for anything other than research, you'd want to check with the individual college managing that student paper.
